Belief Propagation in JAX.
We currently just support Gaussian models, but allow for nonlinear factors and robust potentials.
Thus the MAP estimate corresponds to solving a nonlinear least squares problem.
The code is based on [this PyTorch colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-nrE95X4UC9FBLR0-cTnsIP_XhA_PZKW?usp=sharing)
by Joseph Ortiz, which is explained at https://gaussianbp.github.io/.
